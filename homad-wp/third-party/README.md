# Third-party packages

Place the vendor ZIP files in a local folder (not tracked in git), for example:

- `woodmart.8.2.7.zip`
- `elementskit-4.1.0.zip`

Then run one of the install scripts in `../scripts/` and provide the folder path when prompted.

> These ZIP files should stay local and must not be committed to this repository.
